### A WikiForum App

## Introduction

Wikipedia is one of the most popular online resources, so on average, people spend quite a bit of time on Wikipedia;
 
yet there is surprisingly little social interaction possibility. 

The talk pages on Wikipedia are predominantly for editorial discussions and not for general discussion on a topic and also have some drawbacks, being basically just a wikipage. 

This project is about building a social media web app around Wikipedia that may offer functions such as forum, recommender, commenting and Q&A functions.

Various ways of linking to Wikipedia content/importing content are possible, ideal would be a system where one can annotate questions and comments directly to specific points in the text.
